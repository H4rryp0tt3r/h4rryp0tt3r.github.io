Hello there!

I am Nagesh, and I'm working as a software developer [@Yelp][yelp-url]{:target="_blank"} in Berlin, Germany.
I'm more of a generalist developer, and I worked on Web, mobile and desktop applications and have a lot of interest for computer security.
In fact most of the posts you find here on this blog are around security, that's how much I love computer security.

I worked on a variety of technologies like Kotlin, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Swift, Rust just to name a few.
You can find me in the links attached to icons in the footer section.
